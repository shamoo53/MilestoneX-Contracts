# Contract Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

- Rust + `rustup` (stable toolchain)
- `stellar-cli`: `cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt`
- WASM target: `rustup target add wasm32v1-none`
- A funded Stellar account (source keypair)

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `STELLAR_SECRET_KEY` | Deployer keypair secret |
| `STELLAR_NETWORK` | `testnet` or `mainnet` |
| `STELLAR_RPC_URL` | Soroban RPC endpoint |

## Testnet Deployment

```bash
make setup && make build
stellar contract deploy   --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/campaign.wasm   --source $STELLAR_SECRET_KEY   --network testnet
```

## Verify Deployment

```bash
stellar contract invoke   --id $CONTRACT_ID   --source $STELLAR_SECRET_KEY   --network testnet   -- version
```

## Mainnet Deployment

```bash
stellar contract deploy   --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/campaign.wasm   --source $STELLAR_SECRET_KEY   --network mainnet   --rpc-url $STELLAR_RPC_URL
```

## Contract Initialization

```bash
stellar contract invoke   --id $CONTRACT_ID   --source $STELLAR_SECRET_KEY   --network testnet   -- initialize
```

## Error Code Stability

The campaign contract owns the canonical `#[contracterror]` enum for campaign
failures in `campaign/src/types.rs`. The shared `common` crate intentionally
does not publish a `#[contracterror]` enum; it only contains reusable data
types. This avoids overlapping stable discriminants between shared and
contract-local crates while preserving the campaign error numbers that may
already appear in `Error(Contract, #N)` results.

No migration or redeployment sequencing is required for this cleanup because no
existing campaign error discriminants were renumbered. Off-chain indexers should
continue to interpret campaign failures with the campaign error table.

## Deadline Extensions

Campaign deadline extensions are capped at ten years from the current ledger
timestamp. This prevents accidental or malicious `u64`-scale future dates from
making status views, refund-window checks, milestone release arithmetic, and
campaign reports meaningless while still allowing long-running campaigns.

## Troubleshooting

- **`InsufficientFee`**: Add `--fee 1000000` to the deploy command.
- **`WasmAlreadyExists`**: Binary is already on-chain; proceed directly to `invoke`.
- **WASM target missing**: Run `rustup target add wasm32v1-none`.

## Withdrawal Audit Log

> Issue [#38](https://github.com/MillestoneX/MilestoneX-Contracts/issues/38)

The off-chain withdrawal audit log
(`crates/tools/src/withdrawal_audit.rs`, `WithdrawalAuditLog`) is the primary
**non-blockchain** record of admin actions on creator withdrawals. It keeps an
in-memory buffer for fast reads and a durable append-only on-disk sink so the
trail survives process crashes, restarts, and container eviction.

### On-disk schema

Entries are stored as [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) — one JSON object
per line, append-only. Each line is an independently parseable
`WithdrawalLogEntry`:

| Field             | Type            | Notes                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `campaign_id`     | `u64`           | Campaign the withdrawal belongs to.                                   |
| `recipient`       | `string`        | Creator address (`G...`).                                             |
| `amount`          | `i128`          | Base units; matches the on-chain `WithdrawalRequest.amount`.          |
| `action`          | `string` (enum) | `requested` \| `approved` \| `submitted` \| `rejected` (snake_case).  |
| `actor`           | `string`        | Admin/creator/operator that performed the action.                    |
| `timestamp`       | `i64`           | Audit clock (Unix seconds) from the injectable `Clock`.              |
| `ledger_timestamp`| `u64?`          | On-chain Soroban event time, when known (omitted if absent).         |
| `tx_hash`         | `string?`       | Soroban transaction hash for the on-chain event (omitted if absent). |

Example line:

```json
{"campaign_id":5,"recipient":"GA...","amount":100,"action":"approved","actor":"GADMIN","timestamp":1700000000,"ledger_timestamp":8}
```

Persistence guarantees: the file is opened with `O_APPEND | O_CREAT` (never
truncated), each flush writes all pending entries in a single `write_all`
followed by `fsync` (`sync_all`), and on Unix the file is `chmod 0o600`
(owner-only). `flush_to_disk` is incremental — only entries logged since the
previous successful flush are appended, so periodic flushes never duplicate
lines. On startup, call `WithdrawalAuditLog::load_from_disk` to replay existing
history before logging more (the flush cursor is positioned past all loaded
entries, so the next flush appends rather than re-writes).

### Log rotation policy

- **File naming**: rotate by UTC day — `audit-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`. Operators
  point `flush_to_disk` at the current day's file.
- **Permissions**: every rotated file is `0o600`; the containing directory
  should be `0o700` and owned by the service account.
- **Retention**: keep at least 365 days of audit files for compliance; archive
  (do not delete) older files to cold storage. Because the format is plain
  JSON Lines, files compress well (`gzip`) once a day is closed.
- **Integrity**: files are append-only and never rewritten in place, so an
  out-of-band checksum/anchor of each closed day's file is sufficient for
  tamper-evidence.
- **Timestamps**: production uses `SystemClock` (`chrono::Utc::now()` via the
  `Clock` trait default). Carry `ledger_timestamp` alongside each entry so the
  off-chain audit clock can be cross-checked against on-chain ledger time.

> **Scope note:** a background flusher driven by a long-running worker loop is
> not yet wired — `crates/tools` is currently a synchronous CLI with no
> off-chain withdrawal-event pipeline. Callers flush explicitly. Wiring a
> periodic flusher (and a durable multi-host store such as SQLite/Postgres) is
> tracked as follow-up work in #38.

## Known Limitations / CLI Status

The `milestonex-cli` binary (`crates/tools`) is in active development. Several
commands documented in earlier README revisions are **not yet implemented** in
the binary. This page is the canonical status table for every command name
that has ever appeared in user-facing documentation; it is the source of
truth that both the README and `crates/tools/src/main.rs`'s `help` output link
to. Tracker: [issue #37](https://github.com/MillestoneX/MilestoneX-Contracts/issues/37).

### What to do if your command is missing

1. Confirm the command is `❌ Missing` above — the dispatcher will reply
   `❌ Unknown command: …` followed by the full list of implemented
   commands and a pointer to this page.
2. Use a working alternative from the table, or invoke the native
   `stellar contract …` command directly. Deployment wrappers live in
   `scripts/deploy.sh` and `Makefile` (`make deploy-testnet`,
   `make deploy-sandbox`).
3. If no alternative exists yet, track the gap as part of
   [issue #37](https://github.com/MillestoneX/MilestoneX-Contracts/issues/37).

### Prior track reference

This CLI status audit is filed as a follow-up to
[issue #15](https://github.com/MillestoneX/MilestoneX-Contracts/issues/15),
which originally triaged the `account create`/`fund` flows against the
campaign-lifecycle ledger. The current pass (#37) extends that traceability
across every CLI surface — implemented, stubbed, and missing — so future
contributors have a single source of truth before opening follow-up issues.
The post-#15 stabilization PRs (#60, #58, #54, #53, #57) established the
contract-test and CI baseline this audit relies on; they are not direct
descendants of #15, but adjacent work in the same release series.
