## Naming Convention

- Event names use `snake_case`.
- Topics are a tuple of `(event_name, contract_address)` for domain events, or `("campaign", event_name)` for lifecycle events.
- All amounts are in base units (stroops for XLM, smallest unit for other assets).
- All timestamps are UNIX seconds from the Soroban ledger (`env.ledger().timestamp()`).
