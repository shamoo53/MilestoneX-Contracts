//! Common types shared across the OrbitChain workspace.
//!
//! This crate provides canonical definitions for `CampaignStatus`, `MilestoneStatus`,
//! `AssetInfo`, and `ErrorCode` used by both campaign and core contracts.
//!
//! # Versioning
//! All discriminants are stable — never renumber existing variants.
