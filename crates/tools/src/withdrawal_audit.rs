//! Off-chain withdrawal audit log with durable, append-only persistence.
//!
//! Issue #38 — the audit log is the primary *non-blockchain* record of admin
//! actions (`Requested`, `Approved`, `Submitted`, `Rejected`) on creator
//! withdrawals. An earlier design kept the entire history in process memory
//! only, so any crash, restart, or container eviction silently lost the trail —
//! breaking compliance and post-incident forensics.
//!
//! This module keeps the in-memory buffer for fast reads but adds an
//! **append-only on-disk sink** ([`WithdrawalAuditLog::flush_to_disk`]) that
//! writes [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) with restrictive (`0o600`)
//! permissions, so the log survives process restarts and can be replayed,
//! rotated, and audited later. See `docs/deployment.md` ("Withdrawal audit log")
//! for the rotation policy and on-disk schema.
//!
//! Timestamps come from an injectable [`Clock`] so tests are deterministic and
//! production aligns with a single wall-clock authority. The on-chain Soroban
//! event timestamp can be carried alongside (`ledger_timestamp`) so the
//! off-chain entry and the on-chain `WithdrawalRequested`/`WithdrawalApproved`
//! event can be cross-checked.
//!
//! Note: this module is a self-contained, library-level audit sink. Wiring a
//! periodic background flusher into a long-running worker loop is intentionally
//! out of scope here — `crates/tools` currently ships a synchronous CLI with no
//! off-chain withdrawal-event pipeline. Callers flush explicitly (e.g. after
//! each batch, or on a timer once such a loop exists). Tracked separately.
